## 🔬 About Me

I’m a driven undergraduate student pursuing a B.S. in Materials Science and Engineering at Arizona State University. My experience ranges from building custom CVD systems and growing monolayer 2D materials, to high-pressure synthesis and quality assurance in industrial steel production.

I'm especially passionate about bridging fundamental material science with practical engineering applications — and empowering others through outreach and mentorship.
